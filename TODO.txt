control f and replace
make terminal support a continuous shell, not just a single command
add actual commands to console

your right click menu is kinda weird lol

And then taproot ig

set project so compile and link only updated files on project!, or at the very least don't make it compile if you havent changed anything lol.
asynchronous calls for terminal and console text!

configure project window should be able to import project settings, open file explorer to select destination and files to compile

python breakpoints and stepping for debug should be easy

Bug log:
	- when rearranging tabs, opening new onion doesn't save the new order
	- toggles unsave when typing outside of the widget..
	- resets a file to a blank file sometimes? (probably because im editing source files in two editors at once, it resets the openfiles)

Add README with dependancies
-pyqt5
-pyqtconsole
