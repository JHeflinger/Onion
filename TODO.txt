connect ide output to console

add shell and terminal (NOTE: THIS IS SEPARATE FROM CONSOLE) - make this tab style like vscode
	- one tab is console for onion supported outputs in IDE and onion supported commands
	- one tab is for terminal which is going to basically just be a terminal

Bug log:
	- when rearranging tabs, opening new onion doesn't save the new order
	- toggles unsave when typing outside of the widget..
	- resets a file to a blank file sometimes? (probably because im editing source files in two editors at once, it resets the openfiles)

Add README with dependancies
-pyqt5
-pyqtconsole
