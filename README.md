# Onion
Onion is a text editor written using PyQt5. It aims to emulate similar features to modern text editors such as VSCode or Notepad++.

## Features
Onion currently includes the following features:
- Java script support
- C++ single file script support
- C++ simple project build support
- SDL2 project build support
- Python script support
- Line highlighting
- File explorer
- Console output
- Custom terminal

## How to Use
Onion currently is written for linux systems, but can easily be modified with some path changes to accmodate windows!
You can use onion by running the main.py file. If you're running i3, i'd recommend aliasing this and binding it to a keycommand
for easy access!

## Progress
Currently, Onion is on suspended development until further notice. Although Onion can be used as a typical text editor that is a significant 
upgrade from something like windows notepad, there are still noticeable bugs that have yet to be addressed.
